----- first of all the what is the API ------

API ::: Application Programming Interface


Node js:
            -- Runs js outside the browser
            -- Very fast,it can handle many users at a time , best for the writing the backend

Express
    js:
            -- it is like a helper Lib built on the top of The Node
            -- it is easier to make the api's
            -- organize routes part
            -- helps us to handle the data as the forms,JSON,Errors etc...



Node js is the Much faster so that it is choosen  as the backend
It gives the same language as the frontend and also the backend 

-- it creates the APIs it runs the  logic and connect to the Databasse...
-- it is also non blocking such that it dosen't wait for the user to finish before handeling next ..

app = require('Express")
        now about the settinfg up the backend with the mongo and the frontend as the flutter 
            -> so for that we have to store the sensetive content in the .env file and for the loading the data from the .env to process.env we have to use the 
            require("dotenv")

and for the 
    CORS = cross origin recource sharing 

        calling the backend APis  with the diff ports or the diff browser and if we are not using this the browser blocks the request due to the CORS policy

        so for  that we have to use the  {"cors = require('CORS") = > then as per the app.use(cors()) }

then comes in the picture as the mongoose --Mongodb ODM(object data modeling)
        here the called the process.env is used
        as - >mongoose.connect(process.env._______(varname))
        Helps you define schemas, run queries, and manage data using models.
