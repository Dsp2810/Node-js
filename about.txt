----- first of all the what is the API ------

API ::: Application Programming Interface


Node js:
            -- Runs js outside the browser
            -- Very fast,it can handle many users at a time , best for the writing the backend

Express
    js:
            -- it is like a helper Lib built on the top of The Node
            -- it is easier to make the api's
            -- organize routes part
            -- helps us to handle the data as the forms,JSON,Errors etc...



Node js is the Much faster so that it is choosen  as the backend
It gives the same language as the frontend and also the backend 

-- it creates the APIs it runs the  logic and connect to the Databasse...
-- it is also non blocking such that it dosen't wait for the user to finish before handeling next ..
