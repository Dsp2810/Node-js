API ::: Application Programming Interface


Node js:
            -- Runs js outside the browser
            -- Very fast,it can handle many users at a time , best for the writing the backend

    js:
            -- it is like a helper Lib built on the top of The Node
            -- it is easier to make the api's
            -- organize routes part
            -- helps us to handle the data as the forms,JSON,Errors etc...
